## Why DNS Privacy is Especially Importantï¼Ÿ

Even with the improved privacy and security from encrypted transport protocols, the DNS resolver's privacy policy remains crucial. This is because the service can still view, store, or utilize the DNS query history linked to specific IP addresses or occasionally individual devices.

All ISP operators can easily access your DNS Query logs. If you distrust your ISP, refrain from using it.

### IPv4

```
185.222.222.222
```
or

```
45.11.45.11
```

### IPv6

```
2a09::
```
or

```
2a11::
```

You may need IPv6 with full address in some old devices:

```
2a09:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000
```

```
2a11:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000
```
